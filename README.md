# CSE847_Machine_Learning

In this project for Fall semester 2018, my partner Conner Masini and I will attmpt to classify fake news on twitter using linguistic features and user's temporal behavior as inputs for Long-Short Term Memory and other types of recurrent neural networks. 

Stay tuned for the results! I am excited for this!

Update - [03/18/2018] Analyses of numerical and textural features of true and fake tweets are done.

Next Goal1: Time-series analysis (show promises to be a main difference between true and fake tweets).
Next Goal2: Develop RNN to capture time-series and textural feature.

Update - [04/26/2018] The first version of the model is complete!  Using LSTM recurrent neural network with FF neural network we obtained 76% score. We next going to incorporate tweets interaction using graph theory and spare matrix in the next version!
