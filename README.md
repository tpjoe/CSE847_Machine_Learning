In this project for Fall semester 2018, my partner Conner Masini and I will attmpt to classify fake news on twitter using linguistic features and user's temporal behavior as inputs for Long-Short Term Memory and other types of recurrent neural networks. 

Stay tune for the results! I am excited for this!
